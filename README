function example($unused) {
  echo $unassigned;
}

$unused and $unassigned are highlighted when the cursor is in example().

Bugfix: when use this plugin in vim7.4, I got the following error:

    Error detected while processing function <SNR>79_LocalVarCheck..<SNR>79_FindBadVariables..<SNR>79_Parse:
    line   72:
    E874: (NFA) Could not pop the stack !

Solution: need to escape a & character if use \v in a pattern, and expect to match a literal '&' character
